    "Memory-based collaborative filtering is an neighborhood method in which all recorded user and items interactions are used to generate a prediction. The method identifies a set of 'neighbors' that historically express similar preferences for a given user using a similarity metric. The prediction is thus made for a given user-item by taking a weighted average of preferences across neighbor users.\n",

The two matricies can be combined to recover the initial interactions in addition to infering predictions from missing interactions.\n",
